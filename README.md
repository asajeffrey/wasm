# wasm: Web Assembly in Rust

The goal of this project is to provide tools for manipulating Web
Assembly programs in Rust. These tools will include a zero-copy
streaming lexer, parser, typechecker, interpreter and JIT compiler.

Eventually, this project will allow Servo to execute Web Assembly code
natively. This is a long way away!
